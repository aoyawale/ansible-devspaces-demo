# Ansible DevX 
## End to End Developer Experience, from Dev into Production AAP.

### Tasklist #3:
        1. Now that we have updates to our code base, we've run lint against our playbook, passed the production profile locally, and a successful local molecule run we can then check in our code to Github. 

        - Navigate to the source control tab on the left hand side of the VScode workspace. (Shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+G).

        - Enter a commit message to describe your changes and click on `Commit`. 

        - If an error pops  up to configure your Git username and email please run the following.

        - `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
        - `git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"`

        - Now with git configured try to commit your changes again. 

        - Once commited then sync to the remote repository.
