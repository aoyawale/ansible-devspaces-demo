        1. To configure static code scanning for your Github repo we'll be taking a look at how Ansible code bot works. 

        - Navigate to https://bot.ai.ansible.redhat.com/console 

        - View the repositories available "hammer-redhat/ansible-devspaces-demo"

        - Navigate to the initial scan of the repo: https://github.com/hammer-redhat/ansible-devspaces-demo/pull/2

        - This shows an example of what Ansible code bot detected, fixed and created a PR for inside of our Github repo. 

        - If you'd like to create a schedule for Ansible code bot, view the example below.
